The replacement batteries and charger are optional, but increase the runtime of the robot by nearly a factor of 3!

The SD card is also optional (and probably overkill) but provides an opportunity to save the original pre-loaded Hiwonder card.

__Not listed__: 1/2" aluminum [angle stock](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-2-in-x-3-ft-1-16-in-Thick-Aluminum-Angle-6442/332733650) for TOF bracket ($6).
